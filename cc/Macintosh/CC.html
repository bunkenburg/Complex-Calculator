<H1>Complex Calculator on Apple Macintosh</H1>In the teaching of mathematics, 
the complex numbers are often presented symbolically as entitites of the form z 
= a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, rather than as simple entities, 
geometrically represented by points on the complex plane (the Argand diagram) or 
on the complex sphere (the Riemann sphere). Many of the complex functions become 
much easier to understand using these models. Simple functions like addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, or division, and even more sophisticated ones like 
exponential, logarithm, or the winding number become intuitively obvious. The 
sphere even provides a way of visualizing infinity, and a neighbourhood of 
infinity. 
<P>Complex Calculator is a Macintosh program that implements the functions of a 
usual desk calculator, but accepts input and displays output both symbolically 
and geometrically. In addition, the program can display the action of complex 
functions interactively. The program is to be used in teaching at high school 
and university level. 
<P>Complex Calculator makes complex numbers simple!

  <LI><A href="../CC.html">Java version.</A> The Java version is similar, but has improved functionality and 
  improved interface. You may still benefit from the instructions on how to use 
  the program and the suggestions for its use in teaching and learning about 
  complex numbers. </LI>

<H2>Technical problems and bugs</H2>The program was written under System 6 and 
7. It runs satisfactorily even on the old Mac Plus. I will not develop it any 
further and recommend the <A href="../CC.html">Java version</A> 
instead. 
<P>I'd be grateful if you'd <A href="mailto:alex@inspiracio.com">email me</A> 
with any problems or bugs, or if you'd like the program or the manual in a 
different format. <BR>
