Complex Calculator

A Java application that shows operations with complex numbers graphically.
Shows the two-dimensional number plane and the Riemann sphere.

The first version was on Apple Macintosh System 6 in 1992. 
The first java version is from 6. 1. 1999. I made it in Java 1.1 which introduced inner classes.
I lost the source code of that program, so the present version is based on decompiled byte code.
